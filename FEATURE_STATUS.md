- **RideshareShiftModelTests**: 15 tests (business logic, profit calculations)
- **TollImportTests**: 14 tests (CSV parsing, Excel formulas, shift matching)
- **MathCalculatorTests**: 8 tests (expression evaluation, rideshare scenarios)
- **DateRangeCalculationTests**: 15 tests (week/month filtering, boundaries)
- **CSVImportExportTests**: 4 tests (CSV import/export, tank conversions)

**Execution Time**: ~28 seconds total

#### **UI Tests**: 32 tests across 6 files
- **RideshareShiftTrackingUITests**: Complete shift workflows with photo attachments
- **RideshareExpenseTrackingUITests**: Expense management with photo workflows
- **RideshareTrackerToolsUITests**: Settings, sync, backup/restore, utility features
- **RideshareTrackerUILaunchTests**: App launch and initialization

**Execution Time**: ~5 minutes parallel, ~10+ minutes serial
**Status**: All tests passing, including previously problematic photo picker tests

### üîß MINOR OPTIMIZATION OPPORTUNITIES

#### **UI Test Consolidation**
- **Current**: 32 UI tests across 6 files
- **Potential**: Minor consolidation to ~31 tests for performance optimization
- **Impact**: Performance improvement, not functionality enhancement
- **Priority**: Low (system is working well as-is)

## Technical Architecture

### **Data Layer**
- **Models**: RideshareShift, ExpenseItem with sync metadata
- **Managers**: ShiftDataManager, ExpenseDataManager, CloudSyncManager (singletons)
- **Persistence**: Dual-layer (UserDefaults + iCloud Documents)
- **Image Management**: ImageManager singleton with compression and lifecycle management

### **Advanced Integrations**
- **Calculator Engine**: `CalculatorEngine.swift` with math expression evaluation
- **Toll Processing**: Excel formula parsing, time window matching, image generation
- **Photo Workflows**: Complete integration from capture to storage to viewing
- **Sync Infrastructure**: Production-grade iCloud integration with conflict resolution
