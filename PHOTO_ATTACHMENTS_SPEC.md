# Photo Attachments Feature Specification

## Overview

Add photo/image attachment capability to expenses and shifts for comprehensive record-keeping. Primary use cases include receipt documentation, vehicle damage records, app screenshots, and maintenance documentation.

## Business Requirements

### Core Value Proposition
- **Tax Documentation**: Attach receipt photos to expenses for IRS compliance
- **Damage Protection**: Document vehicle condition and passenger-related issues
- **Data Verification**: Screenshots of Uber/Lyft earnings and trip details
- **Maintenance Records**: Gas receipts, service documentation, pump price photos

### Target Users
- Rideshare drivers needing comprehensive expense documentation
- Drivers dealing with vehicle damage claims
- Users requiring detailed tax records with visual proof

## Technical Architecture

### Data Models

#### ImageAttachment
```swift
struct ImageAttachment: Codable, Identifiable {
    let id: UUID
    let filename: String
    let createdDate: Date
    let type: AttachmentType
    let description: String?
    
    // Computed properties
    var fileURL: URL { /* Documents/Images/{parentID}/{filename} */ }
    var thumbnailURL: URL { /* Documents/Thumbnails/{parentID}/{filename} */ }
}

enum AttachmentType: String, Codable, CaseIterable {
    case receipt = "Receipt"
    case screenshot = "App Screenshot" 
    case gasPump = "Gas Station"
    case damage = "Vehicle Damage"
    case cleaning = "Cleaning Required"
    case maintenance = "Maintenance"
    case other = "Other"
}
```

#### Model Updates
```swift
// ExpenseItem.swift - Add to existing model
@Published var imageAttachments: [ImageAttachment] = []

// RideshareShift.swift - Add to existing model  
@Published var imageAttachments: [ImageAttachment] = []
```

### Storage Strategy

#### File System Structure
```
Documents/
├── Images/
│   ├── expenses/
│   │   └── {expense-id}/
│   │       ├── {image-id}.jpg
│   │       └── {image-id}.jpg
│   └── shifts/
│       └── {shift-id}/
│           ├── {image-id}.jpg
│           └── {image-id}.jpg
├── Thumbnails/
│   ├── expenses/
│   └── shifts/
└── Data/
    ├── expenses.json
    └── shifts.json
```

#### Image Management
- **Format**: JPEG with compression for optimal storage
- **Thumbnails**: Auto-generated 150x150px for grid display
- **Compression**: Automatic sizing (max 2MB per image)
- **Naming**: UUID-based filenames for uniqueness

### Platform Behavior

#### iOS Universal Approach
Same codebase runs on iPhone, iPad, and Mac with platform-appropriate behavior:

**iPhone/iPad:**
- Native camera interface with full touch controls
- Photos app integration for library access
- Touch gestures (pinch-to-zoom, swipe, tap)
- iOS Share Sheet for export options

**Mac:**
- Webcam integration for photo capture
- Desktop Photos app picker
- Mouse/trackpad interaction
- Mac Share Sheet with desktop-appropriate options
- Sandboxed file access (no direct Finder integration)

## User Experience Design

### Photo Capture Flow
1. **Add Photo Button**: Prominent button in expense/shift forms
2. **Source Selection**: PhotosPicker automatically presents camera/library options
3. **Immediate Feedback**: Thumbnail appears immediately after capture
4. **Optional Categorization**: Suggest photo type based on context

### Photo Viewing Experience
1. **Thumbnail Grid**: 2-3 column grid in detail views
2. **Full-Screen Viewer**: Tap thumbnail for immersive viewing
3. **Multi-Photo Navigation**: Swipe between images in viewer
4. **Zoom & Pan**: Standard iOS image interaction patterns

### Photo Management
1. **Multiple Photos**: Support multiple images per record
2. **Delete Workflow**: Long-press or edit mode for deletion
3. **Descriptions**: Optional text descriptions for images
4. **Type Indicators**: Visual indicators for photo categories
